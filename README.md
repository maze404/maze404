- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maze
- I'm a 23 year old guy from Germany who works in IT and is obsessed with anything tech related - even outside of my job.
- I mostly work on Rainmeter skins, as well as on bash and powershell scripts
- I'm also probably the definition of a nerd...

All my scripts are free to use by everyone, however use them at your own risk! I work on them in my spare time, so I dont heavily check or test them for bugs! By using a script, you agree that you are aware of the potential flaws and that I am not liable for anything that happens!
(That being said, if you do find flaws, errors or points for improvement, do not hesitate to text me, I'll fix them ASAP!)
